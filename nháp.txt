Removed: same <ID,date,price>
Same (ID,date): 

2.price (diff), source (same);
4.price (diff), source (diff);

Is it possible to have a data in NDS to have EndDate is not null (greater or smaller than new data startdate) -> Hign change no since EndDate was created by purchase/invoice created date (with current source 1). After StartDate was create by union purchase/invoice of new data and pull from NDS, it will get sorted decs, if there is new or update price, EndDate will always use StartDate of previous row what has same ID value
